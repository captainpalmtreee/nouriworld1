            <h1>Nouri’s Mission</h1>     
                <p>
                All his life he’ve been an athlete. From boxing to Fitness. <br> 
                After an injury in boxing, he used fitness to get him through that transition period which definitely wasn’t easy. His life took a turn 
                and he struggled mentally and physically. His life was in jeopardy, that was his motivation to begin his journey. He didn’t really know 
                what the future held, but he always knew he had the choice to put some work in each day. Fitness saved his life. The idea that so many  
                things in life are out of our control, but we get to choose to do something to get better each day. He now have the ability to help 
                others do the same. <br> </p>
